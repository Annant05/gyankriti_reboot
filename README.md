#Gyankriti

This is the development repository of **Gyankriti ERP**

With the proliferation of the Internet, Management systems like all the domains of Information Technology have known an important evolution.
It is developed using a modern and powerful framework that includes NODE.JS and AWS-SDK. Our system uses AJAX, JQUERY, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript on the client-side. On the server side, we are using various AWS services that are AWS-DynamoDB, AWS-SNS and AWS-elastic beanstalk used to host the website as well as the database. 
In 21st-century Information Technology plays a very important and crucial role in any sector. In our project, we are trying to automate most of the fundamental activities performed by the administration of an organization in a very cost-effective and scalable manner. Our ERP system automates most of the processes and provides greater accessibility to the information.
